#Custom Tags

In additions to [Standard Tags](../Standard_Tags), you can implement your own custom tags. A tag must implement or extends from [Tag](api:stream).

> Notice that the custom tags must be part of RSPC (RSP compiler) rather than your Stream server application.

For real examples, please refer to [tag.dart](source:lib/src/rspc).
