Specifies any Dart expression that will be output to the generated Dart file. For example,

    <td><img src="[=info.isDirectory ? 'file.png': 'directory.png']"/></td>

The expression will be converted to string automatically. In additions, the string will be encoded to escape special XML characters, such as `&` and `<`. If you prefer to encode it differently you can specify the argument called `encode` such as:

    <a href="/foo?key=[=whatever.value, encode: 'query']">foo</a>

If you prefer not to encode at all, you can specify `encode: 'none'`. Then, the value will be output directly.

In additions, you can specify additional arguments to control how an expression is output, such as `firstLine`, `maxlength` and `pre`. For more information, please refer to [Rsp.nnx()](api:stream).
