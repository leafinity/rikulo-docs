#The forward tag

**Syntax 1**

>[forward "*a_uri*"/]

Forwards to the given URI. The content following the forward tag won't be generated.

**Syntax 2**

>[forward *method_name* *name1*="*value1*" *name2*="*value2*"/]

Or,

>[forward *method_name* *name1*="*value1*" *name2*="*value2*"]  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;[var *name3*]  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;...any content including the include, for, and other tags  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;[/var]  
>[/forward]

Forwards the content generated by the given method, which is usually another RSP template. The content following the forward tag won't be generated.

The attributes specify the values for the additional named parameters. You can specify an expression ([[=expression]](=.md)) as the attribute's value.

You can also use [[var]](var.md) to assign the dynamical generated content such as:

    [forward foo flag="[=true]"]
      [var detail]
        <h2>The details</h2>
        [include "details.html"/]
      [/var]
    [/forward]

In the above example, we assume `flag` and `detail` are two named parameters of the `foo` closure. In addition, `flag` is `bool` and `detail` is `String`:

    void foo(HttpConnect connect, {bool flag, String detail}) {
      ...

As shown, you can put any content in [[var]](var.md).
