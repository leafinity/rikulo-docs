#The include tag

**Syntax 1**

>[:include "*a_uri*" /]

Includes the given URI.

> Notice that the tag must end with `/]`.

**Syntax 2**

>[:include *method_name* *name1*="*value1*" *name2*="*value2*" /]

Or,

>[:include *method_name* *name1*="*value1*" *name2*="*value2*"]  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;[:var *name3*]  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;...any content including the include, for, and other tags  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;[/var]  
>[/include]

Includes the content generated by the given method, which is usually another RSP template. The attributes specify the values for the additional named parameters. You can specify an expression ([[=expression]](=.md)) as the attribute's value.

You can also use [[:var]](var.md) to assign the dynamical generated content such as:

    [:include foo flag="[=true]"]
      [:var detail]
        <h2>The details</h2>
        [:include "details.html"/]
      [/var]
    [/include]

In the above example, we assume `flag` and `detail` are two named parameters of the `foo` closure. In addition, `flag` is `bool` and `detail` is `String`:

    void foo(HttpConnect connect, {bool flag, String detail}) {
      ...

As shown, you can put any content in [[:var]](var.md). It allows you to define page fragments which can be assembled into a complete page at runtime. For more information, please refer to [Templating: Composite View Pattern](../Fundamentals/Templating-_Composite_View_Pattern.md).
