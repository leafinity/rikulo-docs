#Standard Attributes

UXL reserves a few attribute names for different purposes. They are called the standard attributes.

> Since the standard attributes have higher priority, you shall not name your setters with any of these names.

* [control](control.md)
* [forEach](forEach.md)
* [if](if.md)
* [on.*event*](on.event.md)
