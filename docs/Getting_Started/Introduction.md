#Introduction

##What is Rikulo

Rikulo is a cross-platform framework for creating amazing Web and native mobile applications
in Dart and HTML 5. You can access your application directly with a modern Web browser without
any plug-in. You can also build it as a native mobile application accessing the device's resources
transparently.

##Download

You can download Rikulo **[here](https://github.com/rikulo/rikulo/downloads)**.

The Rikulo download includes:
