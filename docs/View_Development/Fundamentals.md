#Fundamentals of View Development

A [View](api:view) is the basic building block of the user interface.
In this chapter, we discuss how to develop your own view to provide the unique feature as you want it.

Basically, there are two approaches to implement a view.

* [Building a view with a composite of other views](Build_with_Composite_of_Views.md
).
* [Building a view with DOM elements](Build_with_DOM_Elements).

Of course, you can mix these two appraches to implement a view as you want it.
